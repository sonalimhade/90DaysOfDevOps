- Explain in your own words and examples, what is Shell Scripting for DevOps.

Shell Script is a program through which we can write a bunch of commands, Which will get executed sequentially when we execute or run the script.
In case of devops, with the help of shell script we can perform many monitoring tasks, administrative tasks and routine backups just by sending a set of commands in the form of script.
Shell script aid in automating daily tasks and reducing repeitive tasks.


 - What is `#!/bin/bash?` can we write `#!/bin/sh` as well?

"#!/bin/bash" is known as shebang.This is used to instruct the Operating system to use bash as a command interpreter.
It is a default shell used by majority of the systems. But to explicitly specify the shell type we use Shebang.
We can also use "#!/bin/sh" as a command interpreter. This shebang instructs the internal system shell to start interpreting scripts.
#!/bin/sh is used to execute scripts using sh, which is a Bourne shell. 


 - Write a Shell Script which prints `I will complete #90DaysOofDevOps challenge`

#!/bin/bash

echo "I will complete #90DaysOofDevOps challenge"


 - Write a Shell Script to take user input, input from arguments and print the variables.

 #!/bin/bash

#Taking input from user example
echo "which challenge you have taken?"

#read is used to take input from user
read challenge
echo "I have took $challenge challenge"

#passing argument example
echo "this is day $1"


Output: 

which challenge you have taken?
90daysodDevops
I have took 90daysodDevops challenge
this is day 10


 - Write an Example of If else in Shell Scripting by comparing 2 numbers

 #!/bin/bash

#reading one no from user and passing another no as arguments and comparing them using if else
echo "1st no"
read m
if [ $1 -eq $m ]
then
        echo "Both variables are the same"
else
        echo "Both variables are different"
fi

Output:

./ifelseexample.sh 2
1st no
5
Both variables are different
